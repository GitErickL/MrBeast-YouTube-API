# MrBeast-YouTube-API
I utilize the YouTube API Python implementation to analyze Mr. Beast's YouTube video metrics for the last 50 videos/shorts. This includes correlations between views, likes and comments as well as analyses on large peaks in views, likes and comments. I also analyze differences between videos and shorts.

### Conclusions:

1) There was a strong correlation of 0.94 between likes and comments in Mr. Beast's last 45 YouTube videos suggesting that if a viewer likes a video they also tend to comment, and vice versa.

2) YouTube shorts tend to have low comment counts compared to YouTube videos regardless of how many views/likes a short has suggesting that even if a someone views/likes a video they are not as likely to comment as a person who views/likes a YouTube video.

3) YouTube shorts tend to have high like counts compared to YouTube videos regardless of how many views it has.

Jupyter notebook is heavily documented.
