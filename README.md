# MrBeast-YouTube-API
I utilize the YouTube API Python implementation to analyze Mr. Beast's YouTube video metrics for the last 50 videos/shorts. 

This includes correlations between views, likes and comments as well as analyses on large peaks in views, likes and comments.

I also analyze differences between videos and shorts.

Jupyter notebook is heavily documented.
